Shakespeare's soliloquy

To be or not to be, that is the question.
What is more worthy action of the mind,
suffer the penetrating shots of unfair fortune,
or oppose arms to this torrent of calamities,
and put an end to them with daring resistance?
To die is to sleep. No more?
And for a dream, shall we say, the afflictions ended
and the pains without number,
patrimony of our weak nature?...
This is a term we should eagerly request.
To die is to sleep... and perhaps to dream.
Yes, and see here the great obstacle,
because considering what dreams
may occur in the silence of the grave,
When we have abandoned this mortal wreck,
It is a very powerful reason to stop us.
This is the consideration that makes our unhappiness so long.
Who, if it were not, would put up with the slowness of the courts,
the insolence of the employees,
the outrages that pacifico receives
the merit of the most unworthy men,
the anguish of an ill-paid love,
the injuries and losses of age,
the violence of tyrants,
the contempt of the proud?
When the one who suffers this,
could procure his stillness with only a dagger.
Who could tolerate so much oppression, sweating,
groaning under the weight of an annoying life
if it were not that the fear that there is something beyond Death
(that unknown country from whose limits no traveler returns)
it embarrasses us in doubts
and makes us suffer the evils that surround us;
rather than go looking for others of which we have no certain knowledge?
This forecast makes us all cowards,
so the natural tincture of courage weakens
with the pale varnishes of prudence,
the most important companies
for this sole consideration they change path,
they are not executed and are reduced to vain designs.
But... the beautiful Ofelia! funny girl,
I hope my shortcomings will not be forgotten in your prayers.
